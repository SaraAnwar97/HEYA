### Problem definition
In the past years, social media and technology have encouraged people to stand up for their rights, and object to indignity and dishonor. Subsequently, Egyptian women are starting to stand up more and more every day, and share their daily struggles. We couldnâ€™t help but notice the similarities between those women describing the hardships they go through, and, thus, we thought we could gather up women on a single platform in a hate-free community support platform, where women can share their experiences, and gain knowledge about their rights. 

### Goals and Purpose
The goal of our project is to provide the support every Egyptian woman needs throughout her life. Starting from raising awareness, by providing a wide range of articles about different and diverse topics, such as women rights in Egyptian Law, women rights in Islam and Christianity,  as well as mental health, physical health, pregnancy and motherhood. 

We aim to gather up all a woman needs on a single platform, by being the middle ground between women and other entities like Gynecologists, for health awareness and support, Psychiatrists, for mental health awareness and helping women recover from traumatizing experiences and hardships they go through, and NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) to give them the opportunity to give back to the community by participating in charity work and community service projects.

### Social and Ethical Considerations
Since we are aiming this product to target Egyptian women, we have considered all ethical and societal matters to adhere to the Egyptian culture. Firstly, all data collected are from governmental resources, concerning Egyptian laws. Moreover, when we needed to tackle the topic of Religion, and add articles about women rights in Religion, we made sure to address Islamic rights and Christian rights equally. On the ethical point of view, we made sure in the planning phase to respect and honor the users of the application, provide security and confidentiality of the users and data accompanied to them, and provide secrecy and anonymity of users whenever they feel the need for anonymity. All knowledge and data provided on the application adhere to and respect the Egyptian culture.
